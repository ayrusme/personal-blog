# About Me

Welcome to my digital space! I'm Surya Raman, an Engineering Leader passionate about building scalable systems and leading high-performing teams.

## Professional Journey

I'm an Engineering Leader who transforms complex technical challenges into elegant, scalable solutions. With over 8 years of experience, I've built systems that power millions of users while leading teams that deliver exceptional results.

My journey at [yellow.ai](https://yellow.ai) has been incredible - from scaling messaging infrastructure to handle 8 billion messages per year, to reducing cloud costs by $200,000+ annually. I've grown from an SDE-1 to Engineering Manager, building and leading teams from 6 to 14 engineers.

What drives me is the impact of technology on real-world problems. Whether it's architecting microservices that handle massive scale, optimizing database performance, or mentoring the next generation of developers, I believe in creating environments where engineers can do their best work and deliver exceptional results.

My approach combines deep technical expertise with strong leadership principles. I'm passionate about building inclusive engineering cultures, and staying at the forefront of emerging technologies that can solve tomorrow's challenges.

## Technical Expertise

I work with a diverse stack of technologies that power modern applications. My expertise spans from Node.js and TypeScript for backend development, to Golang and Python for high-performance systems.

When it comes to data, I'm comfortable with both SQL and NoSQL solutions. I work with PostgreSQL and MySQL for relational data, MongoDB for document storage, Elasticsearch for search and analytics, and Redis for caching and real-time data.

On the infrastructure side, I'm passionate about containerization and orchestration. I use Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, Linux for system administration, and Git for version control and collaboration.

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not architecting systems or leading teams, you'll find me embracing life's adventures. I'm a proud dog parent to a [Shih Tzu](https://www.instagram.com/sir.bites_a_lot/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=about_page&utm_campaign=shih_tzu_personal_life) who brings endless joy to my days.

My weekends are often spent on my Royal Enfield Thunderbird 350, exploring new roads and enjoying the freedom of the open highway. When I need to stay active, I hit the court with my badminton skills and my trusty Yonex Muscle Power racquet.

Fueling my productivity is my love for coffee - I'm always experimenting with my Aeropress to get that perfect cup. And when it's time to unwind, you'll find me immersed in Xbox gaming, whether I'm dominating the pitch in FIFA/FC or exploring vast open-world sandbox adventures.

These personal passions keep me balanced and bring fresh perspectives to my professional work. After all, the best engineering solutions often come from a well-rounded life!
